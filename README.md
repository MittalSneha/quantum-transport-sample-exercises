# Quantum Transport – Sample Exercises

This repository contains **representative sample exercises** prepared in support of the proposed course:

**Course 1: Introduction to Quantum Transport in Nanodevices**  
Duration: **14 weeks** | Level: **Adaptable (UG / PG / PhD)**

The materials provided here are **illustrative only** and are intended to give the curriculum committee a **flavor of the computational and conceptual components** of the proposed course.  
The full course content, depth, and assessments will be revised and finalized in accordance with academic background and program requirements.

## Course Objective

The proposed course aims to provide a unified framework for understanding, modeling, and designing nanoscale and molecular electronic devices using:

- Quantum transport theory  
- Green’s function and NEGF methods  
- Atomistic and tight-binding simulations  

A primary learning outcome is to enable students to **develop simple computational programs** for calculating electronic transport through nanoscale systems using **tight-binding and Green’s function approaches**.

---

## Repository Scope

This repository includes **selected Jupyter notebooks** that demonstrate:

- Core ideas in quantum transport
- Minimal numerical implementations
- Conceptual-to-computational progression

These exercises are **not exhaustive** and do not represent the final structure of the course.

## Relation to Proposed Course Modules

The sample exercises broadly align with the following course modules:

- **Module 1:** Fundamentals of quantum transport  
- **Module 2:** Green’s function formalism and numerical implementation  
- **Module 3:** Atomistic modeling and electronic structure  
- **Module 4:** Molecular electronics (introductory examples)  

Advanced topics and research-level implementations are **not included** in this repository.

## Adaptability Across Levels

- **Undergraduate:** Guided notebooks, simplified derivations, conceptual emphasis  
- **Postgraduate:** Full numerical workflows and interpretation  
- **Doctoral:** Extension toward research problems and method development  

Final depth and coverage will be adjusted based on student background.

---

## Tools and Execution

The notebooks are designed to run using:

- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- ASE (Atomistic Simulation Environment)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

No proprietary software is required.

## Notes

- This repository is **private** and intended solely for academic evaluation.
- The full course materials will be **revised and expanded** based on committee feedback and student profile.
