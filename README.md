# Quantum Transport – Sample Exercises

This repository contains **representative sample exercises**.


## Objective

The repository aims to provide a unified framework for understanding, modeling, and designing nanoscale and molecular electronic devices using:

- Quantum transport theory  
- Green’s function and NEGF methods  
- Atomistic and tight-binding simulations  


## Repository Scope

This repository includes **selected Jupyter notebooks** that demonstrate:

- Core ideas in quantum transport
- Minimal numerical implementations
- Conceptual-to-computational progression

---

## Tools and Execution

The notebooks are designed to run using:

- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- ASE (Atomistic Simulation Environment)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

No proprietary software is required.
